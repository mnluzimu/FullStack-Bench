Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please implement an anonymous campus discussion platform for students to communicate and discuss. The platform should have a discussion forum feature that allows students to anonymously post, reply to posts, and participate in discussions. Students should be able to browse and search posts, follow topics of interest, and receive notifications. The platform should ensure user privacy and security, protecting students' personal information. Configure your theme with honeydew as background and dark olive green as component color.
