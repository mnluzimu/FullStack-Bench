Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please implement a short message service platform for sending and managing short messages. The platform should have functionalities for sending short messages, managing user information, configuring policies, and monitoring short message sending situations. Users should be able to send short messages, view short message sending records, configure sending policies, and monitor short message sending situations. Apply azure mist as the background; style all components with dark slate blue.
