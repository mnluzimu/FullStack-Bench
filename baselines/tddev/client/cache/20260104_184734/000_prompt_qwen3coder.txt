Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please implement a website called "World of Imagination" to showcase and inspire users' imagination. The website should have functionalities for showcasing user-created content, sharing ideas, discussing, and interacting. Users should be able to browse others' creative works, share their own ideas via the share ideas form, participate in discussions, and interact with other users. Choose azure mist for the background; set all component colors to dark slate blue.
