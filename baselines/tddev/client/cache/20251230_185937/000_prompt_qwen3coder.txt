Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please implement a text-based strategy browser game where players can choose a race, manage resources, upgrade, and battle. The game should have multiple pages, including the base page, ranking page, store, train page, workers page, upgrades page, bank page, messages page, and reports page. Players can choose from four races: Humans, Dragonborns, Elves, and Dwarfs, each with unique attributes. Players can manage resources, including gold, iron, wood, and wheat, and can upgrade their city, workers, and soldiers. Design the site using seashell as the background and crimson for content blocks.
