Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please implement a smart matrimonial website for users to find partners. The website should have user registration and login functionality, allowing users to create profiles, including uploading photos and filling out personal information. The website should have advanced search and filtering options, enabling users to find suitable partners based on different criteria. The website should also have messaging and chat functionality, allowing users to communicate with each other. Design the site using lemon chiffon as the background and chocolate for content blocks.
