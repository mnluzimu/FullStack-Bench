Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please implement a link tree website for displaying and managing links. The website should have functionalities for adding, editing, and deleting links. Users should be able to create and manage their own link tree, including adding new links, editing existing links, deleting unnecessary links, and sharing their link tree with others through link tree's shareable link. Set overall background to papaya whip, then style components with dark orange.
