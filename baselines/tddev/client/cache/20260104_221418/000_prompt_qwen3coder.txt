Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please implement a travel and camping website and web app for Europe, showcasing tourist attractions and campsites across the continent. The website should have functionalities for searching, booking, and reviewing. Users should be able to browse tourist attractions and campsites in different countries and cities, book attractions and campsites of interest, and review the attractions and campsites they have visited. Establish light pink as the main background and medium violet red for the controls.
