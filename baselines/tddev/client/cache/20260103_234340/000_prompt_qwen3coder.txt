Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please implement a modern diagram maker website for creating and editing diagrams. The website should have functionalities for creating new diagrams, editing existing diagrams, adding and removing diagram elements, and adjusting layout and style. Users should be able to choose from different diagram types, such as flowcharts, organizational charts, and mind maps, and use a drag-and-drop interface to add and arrange diagram elements. Select ghost white for layout background and slate gray for component details.
