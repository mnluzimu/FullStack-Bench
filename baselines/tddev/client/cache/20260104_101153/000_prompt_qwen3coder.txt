Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please implement a detective agency case management app for managing cases and tracking work hours. The app should have functionalities for real-time reporting, data collection and storage, work hours tracking, estimated expense sheet generation, and service assignment sheet. Users should be able to browse case information, submit real-time reports, log work hours, and view estimated expense sheets and service assignment sheets. Apply beige as the background; style all components with saddle brown.
