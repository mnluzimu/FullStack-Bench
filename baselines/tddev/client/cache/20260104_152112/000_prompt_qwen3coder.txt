Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please implement a startup article publishing mini-program to display entrepreneurial experiences and stories. The mini-program should have functions for browsing articles, searching, collecting, and sharing. Users should be able to browse articles in different categories, search for articles of interest, collect favorite articles, and share articles on other platforms. The mini-program should also have user registration and login functions, allowing users to manage their collections and reading history. Style the layout with old lace in the background and rosy brown for the interface.
