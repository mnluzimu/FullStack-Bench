Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please implement an adult vocabulary learning website that includes a variety of quizzes and word games, such as crossword puzzles, unjumble letters, finding synonyms and antonyms, flashcards, and fill-in-the-blank. The website should have a dashboard that displays a progress summary. A set of 10 new words should be taught every week, and users should be able to choose an avatar and play a simple game while waiting in the waiting room. The website should include a home page, 5 activity pages, a dashboard, and blog pages. Assign light gray to body backgrounds and dark red to main components.
