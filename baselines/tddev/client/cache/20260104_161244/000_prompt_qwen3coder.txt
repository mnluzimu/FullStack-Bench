Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please implement a social website for user registration, making friends, and sharing. The website should have a registration function, allowing users to create an account and log in. Users should be able to invite friends to join the website and vote on content. Users should be able to upload pictures and earn points. The website should have a personal homepage that displays user information and updates. Use light cyan as the default background and cadet blue for component styling.
