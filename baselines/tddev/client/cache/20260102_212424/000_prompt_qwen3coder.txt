Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please implement a high-performance sports recruitment platform that connects athletes and sports organizations. The platform should have functionalities for athlete registration, job posting, job application, and message notification. Users should be able to log in, browse job listings, apply for jobs of interest, and receive relevant notifications. Sports organizations should be able to post jobs, and communicate with athletes. Set ghost white as the body background and use slate gray for the UI.
