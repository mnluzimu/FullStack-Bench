Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please implement a website that displays Canadian nutrition facts labels to help users understand food nutrition information. The website should have a product search function, where users can input food names or keywords (such as apple) to search for related nutrition information. The website should also have a nutrition analysis function, where users can input food ingredients (such as chicken, rice, broccoli) and serving sizes to calculate their nutritional value. Additionally, the website should provide a packaging design function, where users can design their own food packaging according to Canadian regulations. Define background as linen; define components with maroon.
