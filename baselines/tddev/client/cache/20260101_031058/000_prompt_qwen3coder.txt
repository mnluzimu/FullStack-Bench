Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please implement a dashboard website for displaying regulatory policies. The website should have data visualization capabilities to clearly display complex regulatory policies. Users should be able to browse and analyze different policies, view related data and charts, and be able to filter and sort as needed. Assign lavender to the background and indigo to the UI elements.
