Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please implement a paper cup manufacturing system to manage inventory, production, and sales of paper cups. The system should have functionalities for managing raw materials, finished products, inventory, production, and sales. Users should be able to record and track the inventory, usage, and sales of raw materials and finished products, and generate detailed reports. The system should also have customer management capabilities, including recording customer information, sales history, and sales statistics. Assign light goldenrod to the background and olive drab to the UI elements.
