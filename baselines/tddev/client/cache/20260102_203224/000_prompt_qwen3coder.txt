Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please implement an internship portal website that connects students with companies offering internship opportunities. The website should have a student panel and a company panel, where students can browse and apply for internships, and companies can post internship positions. The website should also be optimized for speed, navigation, user interface, and user experience. Choose mint cream for the background; set all component colors to teal.
