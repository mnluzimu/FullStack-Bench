Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please implement a website for a credit repair company to generate leads. The website should have a form-filling function, allowing users to input personal information and credit status. The website should also have a credit score inquiry function and an introduction to credit repair services. Users can browse the website, learn about credit repair services, and fill out the form to submit lead information. Set old lace as the body background and use rosy brown for the UI.
