Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please implement a recruitment website for hiring drivers and posting job listings. The website should have functionalities for user registration, job posting, job application, and contact form. Users should be able to register and create profiles, apply for jobs, and manage their contact information. Clients should be able to view their active job postings. The website should include pages such as home, about us, clients, drivers, jobs, and contact. Design the site using white as the background and navy for content blocks.
