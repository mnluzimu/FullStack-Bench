Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please implement a virtual study group website where users can create or join study groups, share resources, and collaborate on projects. The website should have functionalities for creating and joining groups, sharing resources, and collaborating on projects. Users should be able to join groups, download resources, and participate in project discussions. The website should also have a personal center where users can view their personal information. Configure all backgrounds with alice blue and all components with steel blue.
