Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please implement a 2048 game website for users to play the 2048 game. The website should have functionalities for starting a new game, moving tiles, merging tiles, game over, and reviving. Users should be able to start a new game, move tiles up, down, left, or right, merge identical tiles, and win the game by achieving the 2048 result. If the game is over, users can choose to revive and continue playing. Choose linen for the background; set all component colors to maroon.
