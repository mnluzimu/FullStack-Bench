Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please implement a web application for one-to-one coaching sessions to match coaches and users. The application should have functionalities such as personality assessment, user profiles, coaching and mentorship matching, scheduling and session management, and goal setting and progress tracking. Users should be able to complete a personality assessment, create and manage their profiles, search for and select suitable coaches, schedule coaching sessions, and set and track goals. Set the background to beige, and apply saddle brown to components.
