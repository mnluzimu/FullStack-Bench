Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

Buyers should be able to browse and select sellers' cryptocurrency products, conduct transactions, and deposit cryptocurrencies into an escrow account. Sellers should be able to view and manage their products and transaction records. The system should also have transaction confirmation, cryptocurrency release, and dispute resolution functionalities. Initialize the background color with light gray and component color with dark red.
