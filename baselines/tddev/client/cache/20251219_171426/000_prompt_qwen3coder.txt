Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules: 1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data is allowed.   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact environment variables:  DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser, DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp. Every data operation must hit this database.    2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.    3. Configure the repository's `package.json` file so that the command `npm run install:all` can install dependencies for both the frontend and the backend, and `npm run dev` can concurrently start the frontend and the backend services.    user instruction: Please implement a poetry blog website for displaying and sharing poetry content. The website should have functionalities for browsing poetry, searching poetry, posting poetry, and commenting on poetry. Users should be able to browse different types of poetry, search for specific poetry, post their own poetry, and comment on others' poetry. Apply light goldenrod for layout; use olive drab for buttons and cards.
