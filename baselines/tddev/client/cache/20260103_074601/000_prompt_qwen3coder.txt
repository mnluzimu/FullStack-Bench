Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please implement a real-time culinary guide application to display restaurant and recipe information. The application should have functionalities for browsing restaurants, searching recipes, viewing reviews and ratings, and more. Users should be able to browse nearby restaurants, search for specific recipes, view other users' reviews and ratings, and add their own reviews and ratings. Color the background using lemon chiffon and set component styles to chocolate.
