Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please implement a computing task website for performing calculations. The website should have functionalities for inputting mathematical expressions, executing calculations, and displaying results. Users should be able to input mathematical expressions, select the calculation type (e.g., "Basic Arithmetic"), execute the calculation, and view the calculation results. Use mint cream as the screen background and teal for component highlights.
