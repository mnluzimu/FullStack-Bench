Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please implement a time attendance system to record employee attendance. The system should have functionalities for employee clocking in and out, and viewing attendance records. Employees should be able to clock in and out, and view their own attendance records, including attendance time and absence time. Administrators should be able to view all employees' attendance records, perform statistics, and analysis. Specify papaya whip as the base color and dark orange for all components.
