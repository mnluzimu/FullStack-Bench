Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

The website should have functionalities for player statistics tracking, team management, and live game simulation. Users should be able to view detailed player statistics, manage team rosters and finances, simulate games, and view the results. Users should also be able to adjust team strategies and lineups based on their management decisions. Apply floral white for the layout background and dark goldenrod for interactive elements.
