Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please implement an entertainment directory website to display band information and advertisements. The website should have band registration and login functionality, allowing band members to input their bio, provide picture links and audio sample links, and provide direct links to YouTube videos. Additionally, the website should allow advertisers to register, log in, and upload their ad content. Users should be able to browse band information, listen to audio samples, watch videos, and view advertisements. Implement floral white for the page background and dark goldenrod for the elements.
