Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please implement a website for a clinical office to display office information and services. The website should have basic pages, including a homepage, about us, services, and contact us. Users should be able to browse the website, learn about the office's information, view the services provided, and contact the office through the contact page. The website should also have a simple navigation menu to help users quickly find the information they need. Style all pages with a light cyan background and cadet blue components.
