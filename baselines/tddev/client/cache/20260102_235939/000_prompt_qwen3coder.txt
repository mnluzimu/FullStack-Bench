Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please develop a student portal website for registration and management of student information. The website should have user registration and profile management features, allowing students to input and manage personal details, qualifications, and career preferences. The website should also have an advanced matching algorithm that matches students with training providers based on criteria such as qualifications, location, field of study, and career interests. Additionally, the website should streamline the application process with an intuitive interface, allowing students to easily apply for programs. Training providers should also be able to access student information based on predefined criteria to enable direct communication and attraction of students to their skills development programs. Establish azure as the main background and midnight blue for the controls.
