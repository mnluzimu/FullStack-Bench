Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please implement an online trivia contest app for hosting knowledge competitions. The app should have functionalities for contest enrollment, question display, answer submission, scoring, and leaderboard. Users should be able to browse and enroll in contests, answer contest questions, submit answers, view their scores and rankings, and compare their performance with others on the leaderboard. Specify beige as the base color and saddle brown for all components.
