Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please implement an online learning platform for data science that provides Python data science courses. The platform should have functionalities for browsing courses, learning courses, submitting assignments, and querying grades. Users should be able to browse and select Python data science courses of interest, learn course content, submit assignments, and query their own learning grades. Use honeydew in the background layer and dark olive green for the component layer.
