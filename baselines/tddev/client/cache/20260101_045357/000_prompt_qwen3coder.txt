Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please develop a web-based Texas Hold'em poker game with features such as game lobby, table games, and chat functionality. Users should be able to create or join game rooms, play Texas Hold'em, view game records, and manage their account information. The game lobby should display available game rooms, current game status, and player information. The table game should display player hand cards, community cards, betting information, and action buttons. Implement azure for the page background and midnight blue for the elements.
