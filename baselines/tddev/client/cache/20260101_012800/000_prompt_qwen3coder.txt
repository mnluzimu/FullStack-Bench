Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please implement a multi-company dashboard for managing and displaying financial data from multiple companies. The dashboard should be able to collect and display financial information from each company, provide consolidated reports, and support cross-company comparisons and reporting. Users should be able to browse financial data from each company, view consolidated reports, and perform financial management and reporting. Apply mint cream as the background; style all components with teal.
