Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please implement a family event portal website for publishing and storing obituaries, funeral arrangements, and multimedia memories. The website should have functionalities for obituary publishing, mortuary list, condolences, and statistics. Users should be able to publish and manage their own obituaries and funeral arrangements, view and leave messages on others' obituaries, and view statistical analysis. Use cornsilk for the outer layout and peru for UI blocks.
