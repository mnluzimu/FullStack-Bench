Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules: 1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data is allowed.   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact environment variables:  DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser, DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp. Every data operation must hit this database.    2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.    3. Configure the repository's `package.json` file so that the command `npm run install:all` can install dependencies for both the frontend and the backend, and `npm run dev` can concurrently start the frontend and the backend services.    user instruction: Please implement a website for generating stock reports to provide stock information and analysis. The website should have the functionality to search and summarize stock information, and generate customized stock reports based on user requirements. Users should be able to input stock codes or names, select report formats and content, and the website will automatically generate the corresponding reports. The reports should include basic stock information, market trends, financial data, and more. Set the background color to white and the component color to navy.
