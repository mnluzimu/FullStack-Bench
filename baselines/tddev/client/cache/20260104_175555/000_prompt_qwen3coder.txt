Create a website repository based on the given user instruction with these rules:
1. If the site needs dynamic data, include:
   - A frontend that fetches all data from backend APIs. No hard-coded or mock data.
   - A backend that connects to an external PostgreSQL database using these exact
     environment variables:
       DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5432, DB_USERNAME=myappuser,
       DB_PASSWORD=myapppassword, DB_NAME=myapp.
2. If the site is strictly static (e.g., marketing or documentation), a backend is not required.
3. Configure the repository's `package.json` so that
   - `npm run install:all` installs both FE & BE, and
   - `npm run dev` starts both concurrently.

user instruction: Please implement a skill sharing platform for showcasing personal skills and connecting with others. The platform should allow users to create profiles, add skills and certifications, and search for other users based on their qualifications. Users should be able to browse other users' profiles, view their skills and certifications, and contact them. The platform should also have a search feature that allows users to find other users based on their skills and certifications. Apply cornsilk for the layout background and peru for interactive elements.
